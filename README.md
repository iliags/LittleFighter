# LittleFighter

A project I can play around with Paper2D in. May or may not turn into something.

## Build Requirements

- Unreal Engine 4.25
    - Windows
        - Visual Studio 2019
            - Visual Studio 2017 is technically supported by UE4 but 2019 is what is being used
    - Linux
        - Latest supported toolchains should work

## LF2 Tools
I am using [LF2 IDE](https://github.com/ahmetsait/LF2.IDE) to read the data files and assign the correct sprites to the actions.

## Character Implementation Status
Started with Davis just because of his move-set having a mix of reusable features (but not a large number of them) across the different characters.

* :heavy_check_mark: - Fully implemented
* :warning: - Work in progress
* :x: - Not started
